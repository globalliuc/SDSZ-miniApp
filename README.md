# SDSZ-miniApp
A WeChat Mini Program aiming to connect alumni of [The Experimental High School Attached to Beijing Normal University (SDSZ)](http://www.sdsz.com.cn/) throughout North America.

The Mini Program uses a database for SDSZers currently studying or working in North America. Alumni can search for other people by specifying their names, locations or industries. Currently our data is not comprehensive and we welcome people to help us grow the database and keep it up-to-date. 

## Current Status
This is the alpha version and we are only giving demos to members of the "SDSZ Alumni NA DB Committee". Please stay tuned for an upcoming beta version!

## Making Contributions
Please contact [Zichuan Wang](https://github.com/Zichuan-Wang) for participating in the project.
